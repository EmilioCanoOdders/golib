// SetFullscreen switches the game between a window and fullscreen, from the

// its resolution. On macOS it is the system's own fullscreen, the one the
// window's green button enters: the window slides into a space of its own,
// without the menu bar or the Dock, and the player can leave it with that
// button too. There the switch waits until no key or mouse button is held,
// such as the Enter that asked for it, because macOS loses a release that
// comes while the window slides. The screen games draw on keeps its size
// either way: Run scales it to fit, with black bars where the shapes differ,
// unless Config.FillWindow lets it take the monitor's shape.
// Call it from Update, for example on F11 or Alt+Enter:

// In a browser, fullscreen comes only after a key, a click or a touch: on the
// one the game read this call on, as a settings screen does, it comes at
// once; otherwise, as with Config.Fullscreen, at the next one. Leaving is at
// once. The player can leave it themselves with Esc or a phone's gesture;
